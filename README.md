# Brain-Check 🧠✅
#### Presented by Leonardo de Farias and Caleb Jennings, two brainiacs at Emory University

### Theoretical Motivation
Suppose you are having a delightful conversation with a fellow programmer (we will call him Chad) and the two of you are discussing object oriented programming (OOP) in Java. You believe your conversation is fruitful and academically rigorously until he says $$\verb|System.out.println("Java is pass by reference bro!!!")|$$. Having thoroughly studied OOP, you get deeply offended and point out that just because the changes of an $$\verb|ArrayList|$$ passed into a method persist outside of a function, that doesn't mean it's $$\textit{pAss bY ReFeRenCe}$$! Furthermore, you get worried that Chad's programming heresy incured any brain damage.

### What is Brain Check?
**Brain Check** is an iOS application that enables you to see how many brain cells you've lost after hearing something idiotic. Simply click on a button and it will inform you. This application may or may not be trusted by neurologists, brain surgeons, and Rust programmers.

### Tech Stack
The following table shows the tech stack for this project. The project, though rich in content and utility, has a very lightweight tech stack. The **Data Analysis** section is for displaying the $$\textit{Age}$$ to $$\textit{Number of Brain Cells}$$ graph. The **Development** section features the technologies we used to streamline the implementation of the app.
